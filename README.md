# freecodecampFrontEndChallenges



This repository contains the implementation of the frontend challenges for freecodecamp.
The challenges are the following:
  - Random Quote Machine
  - Show the Local Weather
  - Wikipedia Viewer
  - Twitch Api
  - Javascript Calculator
  - Pomodoro Clock
  - Tic Tac Toe Game
  - Simon Says Game

# Methodology used
Instead of creating a single repo for each challenge and as i'm familiar with github i condensed the front end challenges in one package/repo.
As it's not in direct contradiction of the rules and/or objective.
In terms of development methodology i used the following:
  - /calculator/
    - This folder contains the logic bits for the challenges that required some extra logic used.
  - /pomochallenge/
    - this folder contains all the view implementation and also the routing logic used. 
  - /quotesChallenge/
    - Inside this folder are the components i.e views used for the challenges
  - /simonsays/
    - This folder contains the release(aka build files).
  - /tictac/
    - This folder contains the placeholder for the File Metadata challenge upload info
  - /twitchchallenge/
    - This folder contains the implementation of the twitch api challenge
  - /weatherChallenge/
    - This folder contains the implementation of the show the local weather challenge
  - /wikiviewer/
    - This folder contains the implementation of the wikipedia viewer challenge


### Tech

this set of challenges uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
*  HTML - markup language for creating web pages and web applications
* [Node.js] - evented I/O JavaScript runtime
* [JQuery] - A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library
* [Pug] - robust, elegant, feature rich template engine for Node.js
* [Typed.js] - A jQuery typing animation script
* [Bootstrap] - Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web
* [Animate.css] - A cross-browser library of CSS animations

And of course the implementation of the challenges themselves are open source with a [git-repo-url]
 on GitHub.
